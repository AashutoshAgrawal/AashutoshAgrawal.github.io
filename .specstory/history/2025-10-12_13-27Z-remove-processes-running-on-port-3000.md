I'll help you identify and remove any process running on port 3000. Let me check what's currently using that port on your Windows system.

---

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

```
PS C:\Users\Yash\developer-portfolio> netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

Good news! There's currently nothing running on port 3000. The command returned no results, which means port 3000 is free and available.

If you want to double-check or if you suspect something might be using port 3000 intermittently, let me run an additional check using PowerShell's built-in cmdlet:

---

```bash
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

---

Perfect! Port 3000 is completely free. No processes are currently using it.

If you were experiencing issues with port 3000 being in use previously and want to ensure it stays available, here are some helpful commands for future reference:

1. **To check port 3000 status**: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
2. **To kill a process by PID** (if you find one): `taskkill /PID <process_id> /F`
3. **To find and kill Node.js processes** (common on port 3000): `taskkill /IM node.exe /F`

Since port 3000 is currently available, you can now start your development server or any application that needs to use this port without any conflicts!
